U.S. National Park Guide

A friendly little map adventure through America’s most beautiful places!
Welcome to the U.S. National Park Guide. A simple and interactive web 
app that lets you explore some of the most iconic parks in the United States.

What This Project Is:
This project is part of a GIS Mapping exploration module, an interactive map 
powered by Google Maps where each park is marked and ready to be explored.
I wanted to make something that feels welcoming, simple.


Features
- Interactive Map
A custom-styled Google Map designed with a dark, foresty aesthetic  
inspired by campfire nights, pine trees, and national park signs.

- Over 20 Park Markers
Each marker shows a national park across the U.S. including Hawaii and Alaska.
Click one to open a friendly info panel with details about the park.

- Live Weather Info
A quick tap on the marker shows real-time temperature, powered by Open-Meteo.

Type in the name of a park and jump right to it.

Each park reveals:
    - Name
    - Region
    - Description
    - Current temperature

Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Open-Meteo API

Why I Made This:
Aside from meeting project requirements, I wanted to create something pleasant to use, 
something that might spark curiosity or even inspire a future road trip.
It was also a great hands-on way to understand:
    - how GIS works in real projects
    - how map APIs load and display data
    - how filtering and dynamic UI updates work
    - how to make a simple app feel warm and friendly

This project is meant to feel lighthearted and enjoyable. A small adventure wrapped in code.
Feel free to click around, play with filters, and explore parks you’ve never heard of.
